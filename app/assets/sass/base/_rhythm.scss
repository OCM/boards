/**
 * ## Base: Rhythm
 *
 * Vertical rhythm is all about alignment to a baseline grid. Part of that
 * includes keeping margins consistently on the bottom of an element only.
 *
 * This is inspired by several things, including CSSWizardry's single-
 * direction margin declarations [1] and Typecast's steps for establishing
 * vertical rhythm [2].
