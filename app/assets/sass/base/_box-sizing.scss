/**
 * ## Base: Box Sizing
 *
 * Set the global default box-sizing
 *
 * Defaults to `border-box`, per Paul Irish's suggestions[1]. Valid
 * values are `content-box`, `padding-box`, and `border-box`. Their
 * behavior are defined in [2]. Changing this value is a serious
 * change that is likely to break your site without proper updates
 * to the rest of the SCSS. Be careful.
