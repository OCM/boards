/**
 * ## Config: Box Sizing
 *
 * Box sizing decides how the entire CSS box model works, making it more in
 * line with the standard developer's intuition [1]. Per the original idea from
 * Paul Irish of the Chrome team, it is set site-wide to border-box. Don't
 * change this unless you have a very good reason to do so.
